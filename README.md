# CS-3090

    The goal of this repository is to distribute software that I will create in the future
    for managing decentralized digital Identities and verifiable credentials. A few people have already thrown in their attempts at a system that deals with these issues, but I want to try to engineer my own version just as  a personal project to become more familiar with the concepts.
